Download the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/TurtleOld/hasta-la-vista-money/releases/download/v1.4.0/docker-compose.yaml) file and place it in your directory. This file is a sample and serves as a basic template for launching the application. Feel free to modify it as you see fit.

Next, start the application using the command below:
```commandline
docker compose up -d
```
The application will launch in the background. If there are no errors after running the command, open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8090.
